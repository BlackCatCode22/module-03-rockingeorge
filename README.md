Write a program which repeatedly reads integers until the user enters “done”. Once “done” is entered, print out the total, count, and average of the integers. If the user enters anything other than an integer, detect their mistake using try and except and print an error message and skip to the next integers.

Write another program that prompts for a list of numbers as above and at the end prints out both the maximum and minimum of the numbers instead of the average.

Code up Worked Exercise 6.5 as viewed in the video. This program involves prompting the user for a list of numbers, storing these numbers in a list, and then calculating the maximum and minimum numbers after the user has finished entering their numbers. The user indicates they are done by entering "done". Here's how you could implement this in Python.
